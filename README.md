Given an array of Integers, return a List that contains the same numbers as Strings. Except any multiple of 3 should be replaced by the String "Fizz", any multiple of 5 should be replaced by the String "Buzz", and any multiple of both 3 and 5 should be replaced by the String "FizzBuzz".
    
    
   fizzBuzzList( {1, 2, 3} )  ->  [1, 2, "Fizz"]
	 fizzBuzzList( {4, 5, 6} )  ->  [4, "Buzz", 6]
	 fizzBuzzList( {7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15} )  ->  [7, 8, "Fizz", "Buzz", 11, "Fizz", 13, 14, "FizzBuzz"]
